when I started this project the first thing I faced is choosing between Vanilla JS or use a JS Framework after looking at the given resources I realized that the project has a lot of interaction between the DOM and Js(sorting and filtering). so I chose JS Framework (Vue.js to be specific) for that.

I started the project with the Vue-CLI tool to create the boilerplate. then I began with creating the UI with the usual  HTML table tags but then I realized that the UI changes to not being a table in a phone so I scrapped that and started creating with li and div tags with CSS grid and also a bit of a flexbox to create the tables and also used bootstrap for the rest of the UI.

then I created the sorting components and methods where I used a little bit of open souces code for that and then I added the frontend filtering methods because there wasn't any backend provided or any mission create a backend. so I move forward with frontend filtering with that I completed mission 1 then I committed that.

after that, I started the second mission, I only added a modal UX for the extra filtering methods such as from, to and subject, and body inspect. on the same token, I also added a route for viewing the body of the mail. with that, I also completed the second mission. then push those code to Github.

for the final mission, I tried using adobe xd for creating the UI mockups but for some reason, it wasn't opening on my computer so instead of fixing that I start creating with Figma and it took a while to get used to that but I finally get through and completed UI and added to the repo.
